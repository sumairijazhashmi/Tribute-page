# Tribute page
I created a Tribute page website as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. This project is the second of five projects required to complete the certification. In this project, I had to build a website that was functionally similar to [https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/)
